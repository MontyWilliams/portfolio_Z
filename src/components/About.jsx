                <p className="text-xl">For the majority of life I built with my hands and when I looked at technology,
                 software, the internet etc. like most people I thought of these intellectual Harvard science types who
                  did complex math problems all day (Interesting fact: most people I've met with those degrees haven't
                   actually written much code). I never associated technology with building or creating, I considered it
                    to be one of those things in life, like being a doctor, or a lawyer or an astronaut that were
                     possible but maybe something you had to start planning on earlier in life if you want to get into.</p>
                <br />
                <p className="text-xl mt-20">Now after over a calendar year of study in a structured fullstack web dev curriculum and working with many
                   talented individuals throughout my local community, participating in hackathons and local meetups, 
                   sharing my  projects and seeing what others are  building I can now clearly see technology becoming the 
                   foundation of so many other ideas and groups coming together and making an impact as they implement their 
                   strategies and its almost as if their is an unseen intellectual force that drives a technology as it develops
                    inside the minds of individuals and gradually evolves and is changed by all who contribute in the process.
                     As a full stack web developer I intend to act as I always have. As the builder who takes his part, playing
                      his position and making the long term vision mature and manifest, Technology is always extraordinary, 
                      fascinating,  exciting, forever innovating and improving, but I'm still just a builder doing what I like to do.</p>
